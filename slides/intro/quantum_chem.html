    <ul>
        <li>To study these problems, we use quantum chemistry where our goal is to describe the behavior of electrons
            and nuclei full stop.</li>
        <li>In order to do this, we need to solve the time independent schrodinger equation.</li>
        <li>Here \( \hat{H}_e \) is the electronic Hamiltonian that describes exactly how everything in our system
            interacts and we know it.</li>
        <li>\(\Psi\) is the wave function and it's what we're solving for. It contains all the information about the
            system.</li>
        <li>Solving this equation exactly is really challenging and expensive to do.</li>
        <li>For any fans of complexity theory out there, this problem is NP-hard, aka really hard.</li>
        <li>The majority of my research aims to reduce this cost without giving up too much accuracy.</li>
