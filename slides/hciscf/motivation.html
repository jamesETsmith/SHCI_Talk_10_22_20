    <li>Now we look at species where a small active spaces aren't enough </li>

        <li>So that was the warm up, we still have two of the other three molecules to look at.</li>
        <li>These ones are a bit harder. You need an active space that's bigger than the one we used on the previous
            slide. So big that we can't even do regular CASSCF.</li>
        <li>For these species, we need to make a few more approximations, aka cut some more corners. BUT when we do this
            we want to make sure we aren't losing too much accuracy.</li>
