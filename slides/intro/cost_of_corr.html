    <ul>
        <li>When we include all possible determinants/configurations in our CI wave function, we call it the
            Full CI wave function </li>
        <li>This wave function has some important properties. It's exact (for a given basis) which is great, we love
            when we get things totally right.</li>
        <li>We often want to know how wrong the HF energy is compared to FCI and since we talk about this so much we
            have a special name for this error: the correlation energy</li>
        <li>Unfortunately, there's no free lunch so this exactness comes at a price. The cost <em>just to store</em> the
            FCI wave function grows combinatorially with system size.</li>
        <li>To show you what I mean by that, I've created a fancy little figure.</li>
        <li>Here on the x-axis we have the size of our system, on the y-axis we have the memory required to store FCI
            wave functions <em>it's in log scale.</em></li>
        <li>To store a single water molecule, it's easy, your phone has enough memory.</li>
        <li>To do two water molecules, a laptop isn't enough, and we need a single node on a supercomputer.</li>
        <li>I haven't shown three water molecules here because that's off the chart. We'd need more memory than the
            rocky mountain super computer has.</li>
        <li>Given the first few slides of this talk, we're clearly interested in systems more complicated than 3 water
            molecules. So we need to do something about this cost.</li>
